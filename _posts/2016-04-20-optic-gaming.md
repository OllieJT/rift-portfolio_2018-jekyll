#### Content is king.

Since the birth of OpTic Gaming in 2006, the organisation and it's members have used video as a tool to establish themselves as an esports powerhouse. My idea encapsulated this and took their multimedia needs into consideration.

#### Dynamic Content Delivery

OpTic have the following they need to deliver valuable content to it's audience, however sheer popularity is not enough to be the go to platform at this scale. To establish OpTic Gaming as the source of of news that users keep on returning to it's important to communicate content in a clear and consistent manor that puts the users needs first

Users shouldn't have to spend any additional time searching the site for what they came for. OpTic Gaming will have many visitors that come and browse, but this alone is not enough to **maximise the potential of the site and generate page views that turn the site the site into additional value for sponsors**.

#### Elevating the brand

The OpTic brand is more than the logo. It is the people. Whilst many organisations strive to promote their own social media over it's players, OpTic Gaming proudly places it's members in the limelight.

Honouring this value I made team pages a testament to the individual success of each player. Visitors to the site should understand how important each player, manager, and entertainer is. This is why I decided to reinvent the conventional team page found on many esports sites.
